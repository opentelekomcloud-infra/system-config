# This playbook loops through all proxy instances and trigger reload when some backend/frontend is not reachable. This tries to address an issue in the haproxy that it does not recover when backend goes DOWN (even backend servers are up - backend stays DOWN forever). This is occuring once a network between machines is reset.
# The playbook should be executed on a cron basis.
- hosts: proxy
  roles:
    - haproxy_monitor
