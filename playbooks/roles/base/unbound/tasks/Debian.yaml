# We require the defaults file be in place before installing the
# package to work around this bug:
# https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/unbound/+bug/988513
# where we could end up briefly forwarding to a provider's broken
# DNS.

# This file differs from that in the package only by setting
# RESOLVCONF_FORWARDERS to false.
