# In order to enable access to HashiCorp Vault inside jobs it is required to
# provide a base vault token in the executor. It is done by spinning additional
# vault-agent sidecar container which only writes vault access token with
# specified role (and strictly limited privileges) to the specified location,
# from which trusted jobs can read it and further use as defined by jobs.
