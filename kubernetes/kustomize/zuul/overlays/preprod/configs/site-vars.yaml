# Site-specific variables for Zuul executor

# Log storage configuration - Hybrid approach:
# - Swift/OBS: Long-term historical storage (uploaded for all jobs, no auto-deletion)
# - SFS Turbo: Local logs with 90-day retention via CronJob (for quick access)

# Disable Swift/OBS upload temporarily - container zuul-preprod-logs doesn't exist or lacks permissions
zuul_site_upload_logs: false

# OpenStack cloud configuration for Swift log upload
zuul_log_cloud_config: zuul-logs

# Swift/OBS container configuration
zuul_log_container: zuul-preprod-logs
zuul_log_container_public: false  # Private logs - authentication required to view
zuul_log_partition: false
zuul_log_create_indexes: true

# DO NOT set delete_after for Swift - keep logs permanently in OBS
# SFS Turbo cleanup is handled by zuul-logs-cleanup CronJob (90 days)
# zuul_log_delete_after: 0

# Log path is set automatically by set-zuul-log-path-fact role
# DO NOT set zuul_log_path here - it will be generated dynamically per build
